It is up to you what level of complexity you want your game to have, what your game is about, and how it looks. The requirements for a passing grade are:

- You follow the template 
- Your game is only to contain the module (only once, not repeated), and not your own structures
- You decide the content of your story
- Every choice made has to have meaning in the game
- A minimum of two variables that in some way alter the story
- A minimum of two different endings

# To-do:
- Fix skillchecks, add more information and popups. Maybe increase the margin.
- Finish the text.
- Finish the endings, divide them up in two equal slides(?).
